# Moose-Gamification
 A simulator for a moose population and surrounding ecosystems. A student gamification project to make learning more engaging.
 
## Project Description
The purpose of this project has been to *create a product that changes a habit, way of being or
consumer thinking pattern* within the field of *learning*. Our goal has been to create a
*visual presentation of data* that appeals to the consumer and that helps to create
*motivation and commitment to the topic*, while at the same time provide room for variety and expression
with the consumer. We achieve this by applying different methods of *gamification theory*.

### Original idea
The project continues "Helge", a statistical program that shows relevant data about the moose population in
Sweden, led by Christer Kalen for the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. Helge is continued by visually
presenting the statistics through a simulation where the consumer gets the opportunity to *see the development
directly in real time*. The consumer is also given the ability to change the course of the simulation along the way, catering to their wishes or
agenda. Throughout the development period, the programmers have had ongoing contact with Christer in order to
get access to correct data so that the program could be made as authentic as possible.

The program has been developed in **Unity** and the graphics are made from a group of
students from the art & design studies at "HÃ¸gskolen i Innlandet". The program is a prototype with possibility
for expansions in the future.

### Save to PDF
We have developed a standalone PDF-exporter that extracts data from the simulation and generates a PDF report based on it.<br>
Here is an example report:

Alternatively the statistics can be saved to a JSON file.
